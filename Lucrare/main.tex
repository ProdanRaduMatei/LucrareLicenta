\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

SeatSurfer is a modern web and mobile application designed to address the rising need for flexible and efficient seat management in office environments. The system allows employees to book seats in real time, view floor layouts, and manage reservations. Admins can configure office layouts, generate occupancy reports, and analyze usage patterns.

This thesis presents the theoretical and practical underpinnings of database systems applied in the development of SeatSurfer. We explore existing systems, compare architectural choices, and present the technologies used — including Flutter, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Firebase. A relational data model was chosen to enable fast queries, maintain data integrity, and support multi-user interaction.

The development process follows Agile methodology with continuous integration and testing, ensuring modularity, scalability, and maintainability. The final product provides a robust infrastructure for seat reservation, occupancy analytics, and real-time collaboration between employees and administrators.

\chapter{Technologies Used}

\section{Overview of the Tech Stack}
SeatSurfer’s architecture is based on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flutter – frontend UI
    \item Spring Boot – backend API
    \item PostgreSQL – database
    \item Firebase – authentication
\end{itemize}

\section{Flutter: UI Development}
Flutter is an open-source framework by Google that allows cross-platform development from a single codebase \cite{flutter}. With it, SeatSurfer ensures a responsive user experience on Android, iOS, and web using a single codebase.

\section{Spring Boot: Backend Services}
Spring Boot is a powerful Java-based backend framework that simplifies the development of RESTful APIs \cite{springboot}. It enables rapid application development using dependency injection, controller routing, and service-based architecture.

\section{PostgreSQL: Relational Database}
PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database system known for its strong support of transactions, constraints, and indexing \cite{postgresql}. SeatSurfer stores seat, booking, and user data in PostgreSQL using a normalized schema.

\section{Firebase: Authentication and Messaging}
Firebase offers secure authentication and session control for both users and admins \cite{firebase}. It integrates easily with Flutter and provides token-based authentication used by the backend for access control.

\section{Development Tools}
The following tools were used throughout the project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Visual Studio Code – frontend
    \item IntelliJ IDEA – backend
    \item Postman – API testing
    \item GitHub – version control
\end{itemize}

% CHAPTER 4
% =======================
\chapter{System Architecture}

\section{Overview}

The architecture of SeatSurfer follows a layered and modular design to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clarity. The system consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A Flutter-based frontend for mobile and web clients
    \item A Spring Boot REST API backend
    \item A PostgreSQL relational database
    \item Firebase authentication for login and role management
\end{itemize}

Communication between components is stateless and performed via RESTful HTTP endpoints. Booking logic, seat layout logic, and occupancy reporting are handled exclusively on the backend.

\section{Entity-Relationship Diagram}

The core data model is relational and consists of the following entities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User} — a person with an email, role (user/admin), and associated bookings
    \item \textbf{Floor} — a uniquely identified floor layout in a building
    \item \textbf{Seat} — a specific seat on a floor, defined by coordinates
    \item \textbf{Booking} — a user's reservation for a given seat and date
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2.5cm, every node/.style={draw, minimum height=1.2cm, minimum width=2.8cm}]
        \node (user) {User};
        \node (booking) [right of=user, xshift=4cm] {Booking};
        \node (seat) [below of=booking] {Seat};
        \node (floor) [below of=seat] {Floor};

        \draw[->] (user) -- node[above] {userId} (booking);
        \draw[->] (booking) -- node[right] {seatId} (seat);
        \draw[->] (seat) -- node[right] {floorId} (floor);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Entity-Relationship Diagram of the SeatSurfer Database}
    \label{fig:erd}
\end{figure}

This schema is normalized, with foreign key relationships ensuring data consistency. Additional constraints like unique bookings per user per date are enforced at the database level.

\section{Backend Architecture (Spring Boot)}

The backend follows a clean separation of concerns using the standard structure:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Controller Layer} — handles incoming HTTP requests
    \item \textbf{Service Layer} — contains business logic
    \item \textbf{Repository Layer} — interacts with the database via Spring Data JPA
\end{itemize}

Each entity (e.g., `Seat`, `Booking`) has its own `Controller`, `Service`, and `Repository`. Example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item `BookingController.java` exposes `/api/bookings`
    \item `BookingService.java` contains logic to prevent double bookings
    \item `BookingRepository.java` provides query methods using JPA
\end{itemize}

\section{Frontend Integration (Flutter)}

The Flutter application interacts with the backend through HTTP REST API calls. Users are authenticated via Firebase, and the access token is sent in the request headers.

The frontend maintains the current session, makes API calls to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Display available seats per floor/date
    \item Send booking/cancel requests
    \item Display future bookings, occupancy charts
\end{itemize}

\section{System Interaction Diagram}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2.3cm, every node/.style={draw, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=1cm}]
        \node (user) {Flutter App};
        \node (controller) [below of=user] {Spring Boot Controller};
        \node (service) [below of=controller] {Service Layer};
        \node (repo) [below of=service] {Repository Layer};
        \node (db) [below of=repo] {PostgreSQL DB};

        \draw[->] (user) -- node[right] {HTTP + JWT} (controller);
        \draw[->] (controller) -- (service);
        \draw[->] (service) -- (repo);
        \draw[->] (repo) -- (db);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{System Architecture Flow}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

The design allows each layer to evolve independently. For example, switching from PostgreSQL to MySQL, or adding a caching layer like Redis, would not affect the controller or frontend.
